# GDP-Football
My first project during the studies @ HSLU (October 2019)

In the present study, a time series analysis was carried out within the framework of the TSA module. The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between the share prices of football clubs and the gross domestic products of the countries in which the clubs are based. The following section explains how the required data can be accessed, what correlations exist or do not exist and what predictions can be made on the basis of these correlations.

After the hypothesis was tested, however, it had to be concluded that there was no causal relationship between the correlation strengths and league membership. Accordingly, the thesis had to be rejected. The comparison of football shares and GDP is only of limited use but still provided a lot of insights into the time series analysis with R.

Key Take outs:
- AUTOarima / ADF Test
- Correlation on TimeSeries
- tidyquant (economic data)
